The thesis main objectives are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design and train a neural network architecture for the urban perception problem,
    with close accuracy to previous architectures, but with explainable results up to the instance level.
    \item Design an end-to-end learning scheme for the chosen architecture.
\end{enumerate}

The secondary objectives are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Make and aggregated analysis and interpretation of the results generated by the model.
    \item Study an example of the trade of between accuracy and explainability in machine learning.
\end{enumerate}
